    let age = 100
    let age2 = age

    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2)

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    const players2 = players
    console.log(players, players2)

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    players2[3] = 'Lux'

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, players2)

    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    
    // one way
    const team = players.slice()

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team2 = [].concat(players)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team3 = [...players]

    const team4 = Array.from(players)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const guy = person
    guy.age = 99
    console.log(person)

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const guy2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 80})
    console.log(person, guy, guy2)

    // object ...spread
    const guy3 = {...person}
    console.log(guy3)

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
